Predicting Student Percentage with Supervised Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project involves applying supervised machine learning techniques to predict a student's percentage based on the number of study hours. It's a simple linear regression task, as it focuses on two variables: study hours and student percentage.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can estimate a student's percentage based on the number of hours they study. By utilizing this model, we aim to provide valuable insights for educators, students, and parents to understand the relationship between study hours and academic performance.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains records of students' study hours and their corresponding percentage scores. It serves as the foundation for our machine-learning model.

Methodology
Data Preparation: We start by exploring and preprocessing the dataset, handling any missing values or outliers as necessary.

Data Visualization: Visualizations are created to gain insights into the data and understand the relationship between study hours and student percentages.

Model Development: A simple linear regression model is implemented to predict student percentages based on study hours. The model is trained using the dataset.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using relevant evaluation metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

Prediction: We use the trained model to predict the percentage a student is likely to score if they study for a specified number of hours, such as 9.25 hours per day.

Usage
To predict a student's score for a specific number of study hours, you can use the provided code. Simply input the desired study hours, and the model will provide the predicted percentage.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

Example Prediction
If a student studies for 9.25 hours per day, the model predicts their score to be  92.39.
